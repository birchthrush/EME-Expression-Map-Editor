# Expression Map Editor (EME)

## Features

## Known Limitations 
<details>
  <summary><strong>Limited support for musical symbols</strong></summary>

  These are currently shown (and can be assigned) using their underlying numerical code, *not* their proper graphical representation. If you make extensive use of Symbols, it is recommended you use a text attribute as a placeholder and make proper assignment of symbols later within Cubase instead. 
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Limited error checking</strong></summary>

  For example, EME does not explicitly forbid the creation of multiple articulations with identical names - however doing so will result in undefined behavior once imported back into Cubase. Employ common sense.

## Disclaimer
While EME has been tested extensively without issue, do note that this program relies on reverse-engineering an undocumented format - as such, perfect reliability cannot be guaranteed. Future versions of Cubase may introduce changes to the format that create compatibility issues. Compatibility has not been verified with other third-party expression map tools/generators. Use at your own risk.
